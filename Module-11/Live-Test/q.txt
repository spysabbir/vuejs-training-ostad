Question

Create a vue 3 project to show this list.

const tasks = ref([{

    name: ‘Task 1’,

    time: 30

}, {

    name: ‘Task 2’,

    time: 40

}, {

    name: ‘Task 3’,

    time: 60

}, {

    name: ‘Task 4’,

    time: 45

}, {

    name: ‘Task 5’,

    time: 50

}]);

=> Show this list in UI

=> There will be an edit button for each object of list

=> On click this button a popup will appear containing a form to update that specific object. 

This must be done in a separate component.

   =>  This form will have two input fields

        => name (type: text)

        => time (type: number)

    => A submit button. On click this button the reactive list given will be updated.
