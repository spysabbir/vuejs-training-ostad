Develop a web application using Vue 3 with the following functionalities:

=> Create a calculator with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). Implement this functionality within a separate component named 'Calculator'.

=> The calculator component should consist of:


=> Two input fields for entering numeric values.
=> One input field for selecting the arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /).
=> Upon submission, display the result below the submit button.


 


=> Implement a separate component to fetch and display data from an API.
=> Utilize the following API: https://animechan.xyz/api/random
=> This API returns a JSON object with the following format:
{
    id: "",
    quote: "",
    anime: "",
    character: ""
}
=> Display the retrieved JSON object data.


 


Note: The provided API generates random text upon each call, so keep this in mind during development to avoid confusion.
